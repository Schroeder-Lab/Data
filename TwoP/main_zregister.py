This script runs the z-registration over a selected number of files
IMPORTANT: Edit registration_defs to choose which files would be edited and changing the ops
Also remember to edit:
    define_directories - for the directories where the files are expected to be
    create_ops_boutton_registration - for the registration and detection options
    run together only sessions with the same registration options
